# Windows 11 Custom Setup

My personal Windows 11 setup for a cleaner, more productive workflow. This is primarily for my own use, but figured I'd document for when I switch computers or if case anyone finds it useful.

## What This Is

I got tired of the default Windows 11 experience and wanted something more aesthetically pleasing and keyboard-driven. This repo contains all my config files for the tools I use to customize Windows.

## Tools Used

- **GlazeWM** - A tiling window manager for Windows. Makes organizing windows way easier than the default snap layouts.
- **YASB** (Yet Another Status Bar) - Custom status bar to replace the default taskbar. Highly customizable.
- **TranslucentTB** - Makes the Windows taskbar transparent. Simple but makes things look cleaner.
- **WezTerm** - A GPU-accelerated terminal emulator. Fast and very customizable.
- **PowerToys** - Mainly using this for the search bar (PowerToys Run). Might switch to Flow Launcher in the future though.

## GlazeWM Keyboard Shortcuts

Here's a cheatsheet of the keyboard shortcuts I use with GlazeWM:
